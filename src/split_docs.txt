His \ntreatment plan has included a multimodal approach: surgery on 21.05.2022 that involved the \nresection of the primary colonic lesion and removal of a single liver  metastasis, followed by \npostoperative radiation therapy and ongoing chemotherapy.  \n \nCurrent imaging suggests stable disease, with no new metastases detected. His liver function tests \nand CEA levels will continue to be monitored closely. The patient's general condition remains stable, \nthough he experiences occasional fatigue and gastrointe stinal discomfort related to his \nchemotherapy regimen.  \n \nRecommendations:  \n1. Continuation of current chemotherapy regimen.  \n2. Regular follow -up imaging (every 3 months).  \n3. Liver function and tumor marker (CEA) assessments.  \n4. Symptomatic management for chemotherapy side effects in consultation with palliative care if \nneeded.  \n \nPlease feel free to reach out for further coordination of care.  \n \nSincerely,    \nDr. Spark")]
